# Domain Extension scanner

This tool allows you to find all the extensions of a domain using your cli.

# Usage
First clone the repository
```git clone https://github.com/KlyntarX69/domain-extension-scanner.git```
then open the `Domain-Expansion.bat` file if you are on Windows. *Linux will be implemented soon!*
and do 
```
cd /Path/
Domain-Expansion.bat
```
And after you do that you will see that it says `Enter Command` and you must enter the domain of the site you want to recon and if you want to put the results in a txt file use the -o parameter and the filename for example

```
C:/Home/~# Domain-Expansion.bat

Enter Command: https://google.com -o output.txt
```
